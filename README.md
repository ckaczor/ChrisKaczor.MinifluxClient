# ChrisKaczor.MinifluxClient

This library can be used to read RSS feeds via the Miniflux API in [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/index.html) or other similar feed readers/servers.

Not fully implemented (at least so far) and only tested with [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/index.html) but works for my needs in [Feed Center](http://github.com/ckaczor/FeedCenter).
